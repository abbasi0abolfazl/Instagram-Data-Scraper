# Instagram Data Scraper

This Python script is a tool for scraping data from Instagram. By entering your own username and password, you can access another user's account and retrieve the following information:

- Number of followers
- Number of following
- Number of posts
- Link and number of likes and comments for each post

## Installation

1. Install the required packages: selenium, BeautifulSoup, and requests.
2. Download the chromedriver.exe file for your operating system and place it in an appropriate location.

## Usage

To use the script, simply call the `instagram_data_scraper` function and provide your own username and password as well as the target user's username.

```python
username = "your_username"
password = "your_password"

instagram_data_scraper(username, password, "target_username")
```

The data will be saved to a JSON file named after the target user's username.

Please note that the script uses Selenium to automate interaction with the Instagram website, which may be against their terms of service. Use at your own risk.

## Improvements

- Use automated login with cookies for a better user experience.
- Avoid using hardcoded patterns in favor of CSS classes for increased flexibility and robustness.
- Improve error handling and reporting, especially when encountering unexpected changes to the Instagram website layout.
- Implement rate limiting or other measures to avoid overloading the Instagram servers with too many requests.
- Implement the ability to scrape more than just the first page of posts, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of the target user's activity.
- Expand the range of data that can be scraped, such as comments on posts, stories, and user profile information.
- Add support for logging in with Facebook or other social media accounts linked to the Instagram account, in addition to traditional username and password authentication.
- Use headless mode with Selenium to improve performance and avoid opening a visible browser window.
- Provide more advanced options for filtering and sorting the scraped data, such as by date range or post type.
